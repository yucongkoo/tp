### Project: EzContact

EzContact is a desktop app made for insurance agents to manage customer details, 
optimized for usage via Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, EzContact can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
<br/>
* **New Feature**: Added a `tag` command that allows users to update tags of a specific customer in EzContact.
    * What it does: Users can update tags associated to a specific customer, by providing tags to add and tags to delete
  through the tag command.
    * Justification: This feature significantly improved the product to make it a better fit to our target audience.
  Through associating descriptive tags to a customer, our users will be more likely to remember their customers and will also be 
  helpful in identifying their customers.
    * Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, from choice of data structure to hold the 
  tags, to handling of certain user behaviours such as handling of duplicate tags provided, conflicting tags provided and
  addition(deletion) of existing(non-existing).
    * Credits: The association between the `Tag` class and `Person` class was originally implemented in AB-3, 
  there was not much modification done to this association.

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.3b` (4 releases) on GitHub
    * Managed the issue tracker and ensured team members' timely delivery of deliverables and team tasks
    * Distributed team tasks on a weekly basis. Hosted the features brainstorming session (Issues [#101](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/issues/101), [141](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/issues/141))
    * Managed bugs reported in PE-D, identified and filtered out duplicate bugs, while assigning each bug to the responsible developer (Issue [#289](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/issues/289)).

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Made the address field of a customer optional (PRs [#68](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/68), [#83](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/83),[#102](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/102), [#197](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/197))
    * Refactored the `JsonAdaptedPerson` structure, introduced JsonAdaptedAttributes(`JsonAdaptedName`, `JsonAdaptedPhone` etc.) to facilitate
  conversion between json format and model type(PR [#103](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/103)). Throughout the process of refactoring,discovered and solved a bug in original AB-3 conversion[PR [#204](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/204)]. 
    * Created UI componenet `FlowPaneLabel` used to display priority, tags and insurances associated to a customer (PRs [#162](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/162), [#208](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/208)).
    * Updated the GUI color scheme and overall design (PR [#189](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/189))
    * Added the functionality of secondary prefix, that is every prefix now has a shorthand representation and a full name representation (PR [#238](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/238))
<br/>
<br/>
