### Project: EzContact

EzContact is a desktop app made for insurance agents to manage customer details,
optimized for usage via Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EzContact can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Priority feature.
  * What it does: Allows users to assign, update or remove priorities from customers in EzContact.
  * Justification: This feature is well-suited for our target users as now they can classify customers into different
  priorities levels, allowing them to know who should they find first for a higher chance of sealing the deal.
  * Highlights:
    * Users can assign three different priority levels: high, medium and low. They can also choose to update or remove the
    priorities assigned to users.
    * The customer list is now sorted according to priority levels, allowing users to have a clear view on who has higher priorities.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Edit feature is not allowed to edit tags, this is to make way for the `tag` feature where users can now add or delete tags without clearing all existing tags.
  * Users can now add priorities through the `add` feature.
  * Displayed list is now in sorted form, ordered by priority levels. [#185](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/185)
  * Improve the overall Ui by adding vectors, product logo and layouts. [#116](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/116), [#193](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/193), [#219](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/219)
