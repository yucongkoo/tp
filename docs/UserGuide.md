# EzContact

## Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide (UG) of **EZContact**

&emsp;&emsp;In the dynamic and ever-evolving world of insurance, staying connected and organized is paramount.
Meet EzContact, your go-to solution designed exclusively for insurance agents. Navigating the complex network of clients,
policies, and leads has never been easier. EzContact empowers you to manage your contacts, streamline communication,

&emsp;&emsp;EzContact is a desktop application that can help you organize your customers' information and reduces the
hassle of having to remember everything. It is optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI), meaning that users would

can view the information easily through the application.

With EZContact, our users are able to :

*  Seamlessly organize your clients' details, policy information, and communication history.
*  Stay on top of their leads, and convert potential clients into loyal customers.
*  Schedule appointments and follow-ups without missing a beat.

&emsp;&emsp;If you are a fast typist, EzContact is the perfect tool for you to keep track of all your customer
, it is faster than any other traditional GUI-based application available in the market! Remember, Time is Money ! The
faster you approach your customer, the more deal you seal.

![UiWithDescription](images/UiWithDescription.png)
As illustrated above, the UI will be split into three sections, we will be providing a name for each section and

1. **Result Display Box:** Box that displays the result of executing the entered command.<br/>
1. **Customer List Panel:** Panel that displays the list of Customer Cards.<br/>
1. **Customer Card:** Card that displays information about each customer.<br/>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `name` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in `[]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/<name> [a/<address>]` can be used as `n/John Doe a/Kent Ridge` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/<tag>]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone number>`, `p/12341234 n/John` is also acceptable.

* Prefixes (i.e. n/, p/, e/, etc) are designed to be short, however, we do still provide the functionality to detect 
full-name prefixes and they can be used interchangeably(e.g. n/ and name/ are interchangeable),
click [here](#prefix-to-full-name-prefix-translation-table) to see a full table of prefix to full-name prefix relation.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* For `tag` and `insurance`, only one of the customer's `tag`/`insurance` must contain keywords as a prefix. </br>
These keywords can be spread across different `tag`/`insurance` entries.

## Advanced Features

### Managing data

EzContact's data is stored as a json file at : `<JAR file directory>/data/addressbook.json`, where `<JAR file directory>`
is the directory you placed our `EzContact.jar` file.

**Saving data:**

EzContact's data is saved automaticaly whenever a command that changes the data is executed.

**Editing the data file:**

Advanced users are welcomed to update the data stored in EzContact directly by editing the `addressbook.json` file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If the format of the file becomes invalid after an edit, EzContact will launch with an empty data file, and will
overwrite the whole data file after a command that changes the data file is executed. Hence, users are **strongly
recommended to store a backup** of the data file before editing it.

</box>

**Storing/Restoring backup data files:**

Users can store a backup of the current data file by simply creating a copy of the `addressbook.json` file.
To restore a previously backed-up file, simply place the json file in the `<JAR file directory>/data` directory
and rename the file to `addressbook.json`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q:** Can I transfer my data to another computer? <br>
**A:** Yes, you can. Install EzContact in the computer and replace the `addressbook.json` file in the `<JAR file directory>/data` directory
with the `addressbook.js` file from your previous computer. <br> <br>
**Q:** Why are there sample customers when I first launch EzContact and how do I get rid of them? <br>
**A:** The sample customers are for new users to try out various commands in EzContact. To get rid of them, simply type `clear` in the
command box.
